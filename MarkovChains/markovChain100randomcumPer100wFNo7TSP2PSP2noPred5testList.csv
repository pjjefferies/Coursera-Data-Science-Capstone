"58","I was blown away by The Dark Knight, it took me completely off guard. I was not expecting as great of a film as it turned out to be. So The Dark Knight Rises has a difficult task of beating out that incredible sequel. The problem I have is that they arenâ€™t giving me enough to get excited off of other than it is a sequel to The Dark Knight. The trailers didnâ€™t impress me and the pictures released had the same effect. I am really worried by what is taking place here. Primarily because Catwoman is in this movie and I despise Catwoman. I hate her character. I find her annoying and bothersome. Also that shot in the trailer with the exploding football field was so stupid. That guy really didnâ€™t feel the explosion. It just didnâ€™t fit in this world Christopher Nolan has created because the scene played as a joke by having the man run for a touchdown and after succeeding notice the stadium was destroyed. I do however, love the look of Bane. Tom Hardy is a fine actor so I know he will perform with this role. There is no way he will be able to beat out Heath Ledgerâ€™s terrific take on The Joker but he will still be good. I am placing my trust in Nolanâ€™s hands to pull this off. It wonâ€™t be as great as The Dark Knight but it will still be a good movie.","i was blown away by the dark knight it took me completely off guard i was not expecting as great of a film as it turned out to be so the dark knight rises has a difficult task of beating out that incredible sequel the problem i have is that they arenâ€™t giving me enough to get excited off of other than it is a sequel to the dark knight the trailers didnâ€™t impress me and the pictures released had the same effect i am really worried by what is taking place here primarily because catwoman is in this movie and i despise catwoman i hate her character i find her annoying and bothersome also that shot in the trailer with the exploding football field was so that guy really didnâ€™t feel the explosion it just didnâ€™t fit in this world christopher nolan has created because the scene played as a joke by having the man run for a touchdown and after succeeding notice the stadium was destroyed i do however love the look of bane tom hardy is a fine actor so i know he will perform with this role there is no way he will be able to beat out heath ledgerâ€™s terrific take on the joker but he will still be good i am placing",219,"my",NA,NA,FALSE
