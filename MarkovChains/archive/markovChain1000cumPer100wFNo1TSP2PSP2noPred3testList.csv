Suddenly, for the last seven minutes, the characters we have come to know have disappeared — and yet the film continues. We see deserted streets, shadows, anonymous strangers. Without the characters to ground us in story, the presence of the camera itself seems stronger. We become aware of it as an apparatus, a seeing-device that acts as its own separate entity. There is camera movement (panning, following a figure walking on a street) which suggests that something is about to be revealed; it seems Antonioni is trying to tell us something. There are some wide, long takes from above that slowly pan around as if surveying the streets. Trees rustle in the wind. A man in a suit rounds a corner. A toddler looks up at his mother. A close up of a man’s earlobe. A stream of water flows into the gutter. “Yes, what is it Antonioni?” I remember thinking, “What are you trying to show us?” I was searching for meaning, for story.
