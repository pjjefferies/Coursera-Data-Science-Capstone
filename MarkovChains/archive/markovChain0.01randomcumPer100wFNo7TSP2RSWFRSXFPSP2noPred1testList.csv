"3989","Before looking into anything else, let us first give some background on Nietzsche‚Äôs personal experiences with the opposite sex. After his father died when he was only five, Nietzsche was left to be raised in a household solely occupied by women (his mother, his sister, and two maiden aunts). How much of an affect this had on developing the young man‚Äôs lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell, but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality. Throughout his life, Nietzsche had few companions (of either gender), and virtually no real romantic relationships (nothing that would qualify as reciprocal love, anyway). In his younger years, he would comment on his determination to remain a lifelong bachelor, because ‚Äúon the whole, I hate the limitations and obligations of the whole civilized order of things so very much that it would be difficult to find a woman free-spirited enough to follow my lead.‚Äù[2] This remark is noteworthy for two reasons: first, his expectation that a woman (even a ‚Äúfree-spirited‚Äù one) is to follow his lead, indicates a base level of chauvinism in Nietzsche‚Äôs mentality towards women. And second, the philosopher seems to think his personal views are much too radical for any woman to either accept, or be capable of following. The letter also serves to illustrate the divergent tones the philosopher adopts, depending on who he is corresponding with at any given time. This is most evident from a later correspondence (this time with a woman), where Nietzsche uncharacteristically expresses a deep longing for a romantic partner:","before looking into anything else let us first give some background on nietzsche‚Äôs personal experiences with the opposite after his father died when he was only five nietzsche was left to be raised in a household solely occupied by women his mother his sister and two maiden aunts how much of an affect this had on developing the young man‚Äôs lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality throughout his life nietzsche had few companions of either gender and virtually no real",94,"romantic","one",0,FALSE

I think it arises out of very noble and worthy intentions, and it seemed to be particularly popular in various periods where strengthening the connections between diverse cultures was desirable in terms of the possibility, therefore, of eliminating differences that could lead to conflict. I am not certain that it is entirely useful or feasible to have made some of these suggestions, or that this overall project is as useful as its proponents still seem to think it is, but one thing is for certain: it depends upon ideas that fall under the broad category of ‚Äúsyncretism‚Äù for its success.

And because of all the tourists, there is a host of scenery that shows how human beings interact with nature. My tendency is to be drawn to what the children are doing, but the youthful wonder we adults have buried (perhaps) seems to really shine in these parts. I don't notice this so much at the beach, so I hope to spend more time this summer somewhere in the mountains. This painting came together with ease, which of course is a treat since it doesn't always go that way. One key difference is that I used poppy seed oil as a medium instead of walnut oil. I had switched to the walnut about a year ago just to try it, and somehow forgot about how much better suited the poppy oil is for my small work.

This might be indicative of a social custom (note: there have been, and still are, many cultures where it is polite to offer a desired item as a gift, and polite to refuse the gift; that might be what we‚Äôre seeing here), or a good-faith offer which Abraham refuses, presumably, because of his fierce independence (which we saw previously in 15:23, where Abraham didn‚Äôt want to enrich himself from the spoils of war). Incidentally, this little exchange means, historically and in modernity, Jews have asserted their right to ownership of the cave of Machpelah in Hebron on rather different grounds than that to the rest of Israel: it‚Äôs theirs because they bought it.

"5107","I‚Äôve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that, ethically, it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn‚Äôt stereotyping people or attack them for their sexual beliefs, comedic intentions aside. Instead, tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that I, along with the rest of the public, should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized. Why had I been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes‚Äîor even just assumptions‚Äîgo as if it was nothing? As if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world, and that I wasn‚Äôt giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time I stayed silent? The basic answer is that I had seen the exploitation of gender and sex be treated as nothing so many times before, both in my real life, and, arguably more importantly for improv comedy, in television comedies. I think it‚Äôs very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm. Television, which is such a staple in most American homes, works like that. It‚Äôs not real life, and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there. Famously, this works on a number of different levels. Subconsciously, one might think of the first televised presidential debate in 1960 in which Kennedy beat out Nixon, as I had been taught in school, because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television. More consciously, and timely, consider the SNL Sarah Palin sketches? How many times was Sarah asked if she could see Russia from her house in her real political campaigns because of a fictitious depiction of herself. With so many people watching and talking about it, it became main stream.","i‚Äôve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that ethically it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn‚Äôt stereotyping people or attack them for their beliefs comedic intentions aside instead tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that i along with the rest of the public should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized why had i been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes‚Äîor even just assumptions‚Äîgo as if it was nothing as if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world and that i wasn‚Äôt giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time i stayed silent the basic answer is that i had seen the exploitation of gender and be treated as nothing so many times before both in my real life and arguably more importantly for improv comedy in television comedies i think it‚Äôs very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm television which is such a staple in most american homes works like that it‚Äôs not real life and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there famously this works on a number of different levels subconsciously one might think of the first televised presidential debate in in which kennedy beat out nixon as i had been taught in school because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television more consciously and timely",278,"consider","the",0.0299999999988358,FALSE

This is done so that the wood has room to expand without warping the decking. I'm not sure what made Mike stop and think about it, but, when does wood expand? When it's hot and wet. Like the 90 degree heat and the rainy weather we've had lately. Which means that the wood is pretty much at it's largest right now. Not to mention the fact that the wood is treated and full of chemicals. That means that as the deck ages, the wood will actually dry out and shrink, causing the what began as 1/8"" gap to become even bigger.

Additionally, two of the three sarcophagi in which king Tut was laid to rest as a mummy are on display, with the third outermost (not on display), made of complete gold and weighing 450 kilograms (over 990 pounds), resting today in the Valley of the Kings housing his mummy still.

"6776","The character of Erlendur is a study in grief. Searching (for the lost loved-one) is a common feature of bereavement and Erlendur‚Äôs life as a policeman is an extension of his futile search for his lost brother. It is a recurring aspect of the Reykjavik Crime Mysteries that the crime under investigation is often an old one in which the identity of the victim becomes as important to uncover as the murderer. And so the constant theme of these books is the solution of crime through the excavation of the past (in Silence of the Grave, Erlendur literally calls in archaeologists to help). Compared with many other crime novels, the outcome of Erlendur‚Äôs investigations is often unconventional in that the plot is not resolved by the arrest of the murderer. The reason for this is that the stories mainly consist of a search for a missing person; sometimes this is a search for the murderer, but just as often it is a search for the identity of the victim, or, if the victim is known, a search for some truth about their life that will reveal their real identity. Not all of these missing persons are successfully found.","the character of erlendur is a study in grief searching for the lost lovedone is a common feature of bereavement and erlendur‚Äôs life as a policeman is an extension of his futile search for his lost brother it is",40,"a","that",0.0300000000006548,FALSE

"6804","Also around this time Bo Coach bid farewell to Mr Korg and brought in Casio RX-1 as well as Denise Y whom handled Casio RX-1 in shows as well as providing vocals and sound effects. Right around this time the band started to put together The Mustard Tape. In true lo fi indie rock fashion, over the span of several weekends, and various basements the songs that made up The Mustard Tape were recorded. In fact most songs on this release were recorded in a different room and on a different date. Originally the core of what was to make up The Mustard Tape were recorded by myself and the band on my old Fostex 4 track at Chris Grant's old house one drunken weekend while his parent's were out of town. Originally recorded that night were ""Mannequin"", ""Welcome Citizens"", ""Fast One"", and ""Head On"""" as well as a cover of The Velvet Underound's ""Heroin"" which was recored well past the inebriated state. Of those songs the only recordings that were kept for release on The Mustard Tape were ""Fast One"" and ""Head On"" as well as all of the out takes that feature Ed playing a guitar nowhere near in tune and somehow playing the melody backwards. Still to this day I can't for the life of me fathom what was wrong with the recordings of ""Mannequin"" and ""Welcome Citizens"" that we did that night. Honestly, they sounded beautiful. Especially ""Mannequin"" the way the violin melody and Conover's vocals so wondrously meshed together. If I recall correctly Noah quipped that they ""sounded too pretty, not dirty enough"" or something to that effect. And hence that is why the version of ""Mannequin"" that does appear on The Mustard Tape is as lo fi as possible. ""Welcome Citizens"" was re- worked when the band combined it with the Half Japanese-esque rambling oddity of""Uncle Roy"" and performed (and subsequently recorded) it as ""Uncle Roy/Welcome Citizens"" at Coffee House which was like a talent show held at Shoreham Wading River High School. You were only supposed to play one song so the figured ""heck with that let's make two songs one"".

"6805","Being a teenager is often about raw emotions - when even the tiniest thing that happens in life seems to matter.

A classmate at school may say something unpleasant that makes you cry; or a boy you like may know nothing of your existence; or you may not be as pretty, intelligent and witty as you would like to be, and hate yourself for being the person you are instead... the list could go on and on. Sometimes, I get asked why teenage books are so dramatic - why the girl may constantly pine for that one boy. Well, just imagine yourself back at high school. There are a limited amount of boys there - and for a teen, high school often equates to 'the world'. Now, imagine that the one and only boy you end up liking does not like you. And again, remember - school is 'the world'. No one else is there that you like.

This was a perplexing amount of faith to show a band which, from its beat beginnings right to its sunshine pop end, never really showed much sales potential. Two things probably acted in the band's favour. Firstly, their beat take on harmony pop was incredibly middle of the road and subsequently enjoyed some airplay during the period. Besides that, reports from the frontline of the era would suggest they were also a versatile live act, as likely to please social and supper club audiences with music and comedy as they were Carnaby Street kids, and it's possible that Pye executives may have hoped that some of that crowd-pleasing ability would cross over into sales of physical product.

"7108","Tonight was the latest inspirational nudge. This started a few months ago when I had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the Bohus Stickning. Further stimulation from other knitters on Ravelry led me to read ""Poems of Color"" from cover to cover tonight. I'm already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors. I'm part Swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more I read about it. The fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt. I love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item. The patterns call for a 60/40 % Rambouillet & Angora blend. The idea of knitting an adult sweater on size 1,2, and 3 needles I think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesn't. I plan to knit a sample from the book Homespun Handknit called ""Northern Lights"". I will test the color choices that I plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater. I have some high grade ultra merino and Cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches. I feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters. It might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber I don't chose for the first. I begin to question, do I make the whole sweater blended wool/angora or just the colorwork? The fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft, should I make the body out of blended fiber too? I guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique. One downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater. Usually I'm a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but I already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true Bohus rather an inspired by Bohus Stickning. I don't plan on changing the color chart layout and I intend to keep the look so it will be easily recognizable as what inspired the design. For those of you who know the Bohus designs, imagine a ""Purple Shimmer"" or the ""Large Lace Collar"" in multiple hued mostly Purple, black and white tones over a white sweater body....","tonight was the latest inspirational nudge this started a few months ago when i had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the bohus stickning further stimulation from other knitters on ravelry led me to read poems of color from cover to cover tonight im already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors im part swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more i read about it the fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt i love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item the patterns call for a rambouillet angora blend the idea of knitting an adult sweater on size and needles i think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesnt i plan to knit a sample from the book homespun handknit called northern lights i will test the color choices that i plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater i have some high grade ultra merino and cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches i feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters it might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber i dont chose for the first i begin to question do i make the whole sweater blended woolangora or just the colorwork the fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft should i make the body out of blended fiber too i guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique one downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater usually im a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but i already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true bohus rather an inspired by bohus stickning i dont plan on changing the color chart layout and i intend to keep the look",403,"so","same",0.0400000000008731,FALSE

With Kickstarter, you know exactly how well it‚Äôll do before it goes into production. You don‚Äôt have to make 2,000 copies of a game and hope they sell.
