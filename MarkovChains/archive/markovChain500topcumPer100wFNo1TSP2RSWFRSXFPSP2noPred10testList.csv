The black color is Behr Beluga. I painted 3 coats, sanding lightly between each one. I didn't remove the doors but I easily could (and probably should) have. I decided to distress them. This my husband wasn't too thrilled about but I know how my kids and their stool had already distressed them over the years so I figured I would save myself the headache and heartache and have them start distressed. I hit it several places with the sander and then used a darker tinted glaze (some watered down acrylic craft paint) over the sanded spots to darken up the distressed areas.","and the paint i have read every blog and article on the web that discusses painting cabinets and i tried something completely different from what i had read",29,"have","you",0.00999999999476131,TRUE,"have",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
