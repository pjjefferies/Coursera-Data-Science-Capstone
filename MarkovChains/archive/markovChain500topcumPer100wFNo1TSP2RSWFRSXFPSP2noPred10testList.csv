In Burberry, I wanted to find THE trench, and I did. How? I walked in, I started looking around, I got approached, and I accepted the offer of help. I told the sales assistant that I was only looking (I said this first off), but I felt it time to think about investing in a trench (given I've been considering this for ten years, my sense of time clearly is fluid). The ensuing discussion and try-ons were about fitting me. That's it. I took the information on the sales assistant's card. When I decide to purchase it, he's who I call.
