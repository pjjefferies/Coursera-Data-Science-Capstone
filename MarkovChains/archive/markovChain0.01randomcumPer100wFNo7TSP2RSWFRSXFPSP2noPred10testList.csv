How much of an affect this had on developing the young man‚Äôs lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell, but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality. Throughout his life, Nietzsche had few companions (of either gender), and virtually no real romantic relationships (nothing that would qualify as reciprocal love, anyway). In his younger years, he would comment on his determination to remain a lifelong bachelor, because ‚Äúon the whole, I hate the limitations and obligations of the whole civilized order of things so very much that it would be difficult to find a woman free-spirited enough to follow my lead.‚Äù[2] This remark is noteworthy for two reasons: first, his expectation that a woman (even a ‚Äúfree-spirited‚Äù one) is to follow his lead, indicates a base level of chauvinism in Nietzsche‚Äôs mentality towards women. And second, the philosopher seems to think his personal views are much too radical for any woman to either accept, or be capable of following. The letter also serves to illustrate the divergent tones the philosopher adopts, depending on who he is corresponding with at any given time. This is most evident from a later correspondence (this time with a woman), where Nietzsche uncharacteristically expresses a deep longing for a romantic partner:","before looking into anything else let us first give some background on nietzsche‚Äôs personal experiences with the opposite after his father died when he was only five nietzsche was left to be raised in a household solely occupied by women his mother his sister and two maiden aunts how much of an affect this had on developing the young man‚Äôs lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality throughout his life nietzsche had few companions of either gender and virtually no real",94,"romantic","one","longer","matter","not","idea","more","other","way","time","need",0.0200000000004366,FALSE

Archetypalism is an attempt, I think, to bridge the gap between as many cultures as possible, and to strengthen the notion that there is a basic and fundamental unity between humans and a continuity of experience and perception across human individuality. I think it arises out of very noble and worthy intentions, and it seemed to be particularly popular in various periods where strengthening the connections between diverse cultures was desirable in terms of the possibility, therefore, of eliminating differences that could lead to conflict. I am not certain that it is entirely useful or feasible to have made some of these suggestions, or that this overall project is as useful as its proponents still seem to think it is, but one thing is for certain: it depends upon ideas that fall under the broad category of ‚Äúsyncretism‚Äù for its success.

"7923","Sarah‚Äôs death takes only two verse from Chapter 23; the remainder is dedicated to an unusually detailed accounting of a bargain and oral contract struck between Abraham and Ephron the Hittite. Getting back to our historical roots, this passage is a popular one for people trying to date the Torah, since it details a very specific sort of contract with some unusual-seeming invocations, but here again we end up struck by the staticity of Near East social customs, in that the various exhortations to ‚ÄúHear me!‚Äù preceding an element of the contract are in fact standard parts of Mesopotamian oral-contract practice in several cultures spanning at least a millennium. If we ignore the peculiar verbiage, what we have is mostly a negotiation characterized by excessive politeness: buth the Hittites and Ephron himself are anxious to maintain good relations with Abraham, but the haggling is all upwards: despite Ephron‚Äôs offering of the cave as a gift, Abraham insists on paying for it. This might be indicative of a social custom (note: there have been, and still are, many cultures where it is polite to offer a desired item as a gift, and polite to refuse the gift; that might be what we‚Äôre seeing here), or a good-faith offer which Abraham refuses, presumably, because of his fierce independence (which we saw previously in 15:23, where Abraham didn‚Äôt want to enrich himself from the spoils of war). Incidentally, this little exchange means, historically and in modernity, Jews have asserted their right to ownership of the cave of Machpelah in Hebron on rather different grounds than that to the rest of Israel: it‚Äôs theirs because they bought it. Since it‚Äôs also a Muslim holy site, this is, unsurprisingly, a hotly debated contention.","sarah‚Äôs death takes only two verse from chapter the remainder is dedicated to an unusually detailed accounting of a bargain and contract struck between abraham and ephron the hittite getting back to our historical roots this passage is a popular one for people trying to date the torah since it details a very specific sort of contract with some unusualseeming invocations but here again we end up struck by the staticity of near east social customs in that the various exhortations to ‚Äúhear me‚Äù preceding an element of the contract are in fact standard parts of mesopotamian contract practice in several cultures spanning at least a millennium if we ignore the peculiar verbiage what we have is mostly a negotiation characterized by excessive politeness buth the hittites and ephron himself are anxious to maintain good relations with abraham but the haggling is all upwards despite ephron‚Äôs offering of the",150,"cave","diamonds","the","my","this","course","his","it","her","our","them",0.0400000000008731,FALSE

"8346","I‚Äôve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that, ethically, it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn‚Äôt stereotyping people or attack them for their sexual beliefs, comedic intentions aside. Instead, tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that I, along with the rest of the public, should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized. Why had I been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes‚Äîor even just assumptions‚Äîgo as if it was nothing? As if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world, and that I wasn‚Äôt giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time I stayed silent? The basic answer is that I had seen the exploitation of gender and sex be treated as nothing so many times before, both in my real life, and, arguably more importantly for improv comedy, in television comedies. I think it‚Äôs very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm. Television, which is such a staple in most American homes, works like that. It‚Äôs not real life, and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there. Famously, this works on a number of different levels. Subconsciously, one might think of the first televised presidential debate in 1960 in which Kennedy beat out Nixon, as I had been taught in school, because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television. More consciously, and timely, consider the SNL Sarah Palin sketches? How many times was Sarah asked if she could see Russia from her house in her real political campaigns because of a fictitious depiction of herself. With so many people watching and talking about it, it became main stream.","i‚Äôve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that ethically it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn‚Äôt stereotyping people or attack them for their beliefs comedic intentions aside instead tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that i along with the rest of the public should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized why had i been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes‚Äîor even just assumptions‚Äîgo as if it was nothing as if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world and that i wasn‚Äôt giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time i stayed silent the basic answer is that i had seen the exploitation of gender and be treated as nothing so many times before both in my real life and arguably more importantly for improv comedy in television comedies i think it‚Äôs very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm television which is such a staple in most american homes works like that it‚Äôs not real life and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there famously this works on a number of different levels subconsciously one might think of the first televised presidential debate in in which kennedy beat out nixon as i had been taught in school because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television more consciously and timely",278,"consider","the","then","it","that","we","in","he","they","is","you",0.0299999999988358,FALSE

When my orientation class began later that day, I walked into the room and realized that the ""snob"" I had seen in the bookstore was in my class! Our orientation classes were small. I think mine had 12 people in it, so what were the odds of the snobby girl from the bookstore being in the same class as me. Later that day, after our parents had left, and we were left alone to mingle with our new friends, Anna and I started talking. I realized in an instant that my initial assessment of her was 100% wrong. She was clearly one of the sweetest girls I had ever met. We became instant friends.

"8522","It was about at this point that Mike felt like something was off, so he went to Google to confirm his suspicions. You see, from Mike's experience with decking, he was always told to add a 1/8"" gap between each board. This is accomplished by placing a nail between each board to give it the desired spacing. This is done so that the wood has room to expand without warping the decking. I'm not sure what made Mike stop and think about it, but, when does wood expand? When it's hot and wet. Like the 90 degree heat and the rainy weather we've had lately. Which means that the wood is pretty much at it's largest right now. Not to mention the fact that the wood is treated and full of chemicals. That means that as the deck ages, the wood will actually dry out and shrink, causing the what began as 1/8"" gap to become even bigger. Like, small children will fall through and be lost forever, big. Okay not that big, but big enough to not look nice and for small things to fall through.","it was about at this point that mike felt like something was off so he went to google to confirm his suspicions you see from mikes experience with decking he was always told to add a gap between each board this is accomplished by placing a nail between each board to give it the desired spacing this is done so that the wood has room to expand without warping the decking im not sure what made mike stop and think about it but when does wood expand when its hot and wet like the degree heat and the rainy weather weve had lately which means that the wood is pretty much at its largest right now not to mention the fact that the wood is treated and full of chemicals that means that as the deck ages the wood will actually dry out and shrink causing the",148,"what","the","them","too","problems","alarms",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.0299999999988358,FALSE

Some singers can slur their words to great effect, helping them to create a certain type of character. That was Askew‚Äôs strategy before, and I enjoyed the results.

It may be required, for instance, while preparing to flat iron your hair, add rollers or flexi rods, or if you want to get that slick down look. In such cases, be very careful. If there is a need for a brush, it is suggested that one with plastic bristles be used for detangling.

Four thousand repetitions will do that for a kid. But his reading repertoire expanded quickly, so I knew it was for real.

The state began sending referrals to other foster care agencies. The Catholic charities challenged the state in court and lost at both the circuit and appellate levels.

These artifacts ranged in items made of gold, silver, precious gems, calcite, alabaster, etc., such as golden perfume bottles and amulets, the Wadjet or eye of Horus, canonic chests and shrine, statue of an one horned Oryx, golden scarab necklace, golden buckle depicting a chariot drawn by horses, the gilded throne and statutes, including life-size statues (1 meter 73 cm) of King Tut. Additionally, two of the three sarcophagi in which king Tut was laid to rest as a mummy are on display, with the third outermost (not on display), made of complete gold and weighing 450 kilograms (over 990 pounds), resting today in the Valley of the Kings housing his mummy still. But the highlight of the museum (a must see to all who visit) is king Tut‚Äôs funerary mask, which was found placed over the mummified head of the king. It is made of gold and inlaid with precious stones (lapis lazuli, turquoise, and carnelian), weighing 11 kilograms (nearly 25 pounds) and is believed to represent what the king really look like. Suffice it to say, that the king certainly lived an extremely affluent life and an inscription on his tomb door declares the king had ‚Äúspent his life in fashioning the images of the gods‚Äù.","during our visit to the egyptian museum in cairo egypt we spent hours looking at the ancient pharonic antiquities and artifacts on display one section of the museum is dedicated to housing the varied treasures of the boy king tutankhamun aka king tut king tut‚Äôs artifacts came from his tomb and included over treasures and affluent items that he supposedly used throughout his life these artifacts ranged in items made of gold silver precious gems calcite alabaster etc such as golden perfume bottles and amulets the wadjet or eye of horus canonic chests and shrine statue of an one horned oryx golden scarab necklace golden buckle depicting a chariot drawn by horses the gilded throne and statutes including lifesize statues meter cm of king tut additionally two of the three sarcophagi in which king tut was laid to rest as a mummy are on display with the third",149,"outermost","same","first","most","world","time","other","way","end","last","best",0.0300000000006548,FALSE

In the book, despite Donna‚Äôs heroic effort at the end to kill Cujo and save Tad, it is all just a little too late. Tad has already died of dehydration. In the movie, after killing Cujo, Donna carried Tad into the house, splashed his face with water, performs mouth to mouth, and successfully brings Tad back from the brink of death. Apparently the young boy dying at the end was just a little too bleak even for this horror movie. And what makes this difference even more interesting is that, Stephen King himself was offered to work on the screenplay for the movie, but he turned it down because he felt it would have been too tempting of an opportunity to change everything he felt he got wrong in the book (and for someone who has no memory of writing the book, you can imagine there might be quite a bit to ‚Äúfix‚Äù in his mind).

Compared with many other crime novels, the outcome of Erlendur‚Äôs investigations is often unconventional in that the plot is not resolved by the arrest of the murderer. The reason for this is that the stories mainly consist of a search for a missing person; sometimes this is a search for the murderer, but just as often it is a search for the identity of the victim, or, if the victim is known, a search for some truth about their life that will reveal their real identity.

Right around this time the band started to put together The Mustard Tape. In true lo fi indie rock fashion, over the span of several weekends, and various basements the songs that made up The Mustard Tape were recorded. In fact most songs on this release were recorded in a different room and on a different date. Originally the core of what was to make up The Mustard Tape were recorded by myself and the band on my old Fostex 4 track at Chris Grant's old house one drunken weekend while his parent's were out of town. Originally recorded that night were ""Mannequin"", ""Welcome Citizens"", ""Fast One"", and ""Head On"""" as well as a cover of The Velvet Underound's ""Heroin"" which was recored well past the inebriated state. Of those songs the only recordings that were kept for release on The Mustard Tape were ""Fast One"" and ""Head On"" as well as all of the out takes that feature Ed playing a guitar nowhere near in tune and somehow playing the melody backwards. Still to this day I can't for the life of me fathom what was wrong with the recordings of ""Mannequin"" and ""Welcome Citizens"" that we did that night. Honestly, they sounded beautiful. Especially ""Mannequin"" the way the violin melody and Conover's vocals so wondrously meshed together. If I recall correctly Noah quipped that they ""sounded too pretty, not dirty enough"" or something to that effect. And hence that is why the version of ""Mannequin"" that does appear on The Mustard Tape is as lo fi as possible. ""Welcome Citizens"" was re- worked when the band combined it with the Half Japanese-esque rambling oddity of""Uncle Roy"" and performed (and subsequently recorded) it as ""Uncle Roy/Welcome Citizens"" at Coffee House which was like a talent show held at Shoreham Wading River High School. You were only supposed to play one song so the figured ""heck with that let's make two songs one"".

He is from Scandinavian decent and white as can be. Andrew belongs to a privileged group of people. He is a white American male with good work ethic from a small town and a small school who has been well educated. Now we could spend a long time delving in to his life and talking about the privileges and benefits or difficulties or get in to a debate about whether or not you think he is actually privileged just because of the aforementioned characteristics. I don't really care. Because the topic of this blog is actually the disadvantage that he faced the other day. We were talking and he was expressing his frustration about a conversation he had had where someone informed him that he could not understand what it was like to be a minority. You may agree with this statement and maybe for the average person in his situation that might be true but Andrew has chosen multiple times in his life to live outside of his comfort zone. He has visited India for several months, Mexico and Colombia. Now did I mention that Andrew is white? I am going to mention it one more time because Andrew is not just white he is white, seriously, sometimes in the winter we have actually debated whether or not he was glowing and it is hardly any better in the summer (sorry Andrew). In the crowds in foreign countries he sticks out like a sore thumb, his presence screams at passersby to badger him, grab him (literally) and to laugh at him. Now he may be able to walk through an airport and not be stopped or to move from country to country with much more ease than the average, he may even be able to get higher paying jobs or all the things that we know go along with his privilege but Andrew does know something about being minority, the stares, the whispers, the butt grabbing, no, I'm not kidding, just ask him the story sometime, and the constant badgering for money.","i am getting off subject already and i havent even introduced the subject of this blog his name is andrew andrew is a true blue northern minnesotan he is from scandinavian decent and white as can be andrew belongs to a privileged group of people he is a white american male with good work ethic from a small town and a small school who has been well educated now we could spend a long time delving in to his life and talking about the privileges and benefits or difficulties or get in to a debate about whether or not you think he is actually privileged just because of the aforementioned characteristics i dont really care because the topic of this blog is actually the disadvantage that he faced the other day we were talking and he was expressing his frustration about a conversation he had had where someone informed him that he could not understand what it was like to be a minority you may agree with this statement and maybe for the average person in his situation that might be true but andrew has chosen multiple times in his life to live outside of his comfort zone he has visited india for several months mexico and colombia now did i mention that andrew is white i am going to mention it one more time because andrew is not just white he is white seriously sometimes in the winter we have actually debated whether or not he was glowing and it is hardly any better in the summer sorry andrew in the crowds in foreign countries he sticks out like a sore thumb his presence screams at passersby to badger him grab him literally and to laugh at him now he may be able to walk through an airport and not be stopped or to move from country to country with much more ease than the average he may even be able to get higher paying jobs or all the things that we know go along with his privilege but andrew does know something about being minority the stares the whispers the grabbing no im not kidding",358,"just","to","the","only","be","have","just","so","that","even","know",0.0299999999988358,TRUE

From 1965- 1969 they were allowed to release eight singles, and also had this one reissued once in order to see if it had more luck on its second outing. This was a perplexing amount of faith to show a band which, from its beat beginnings right to its sunshine pop end, never really showed much sales potential. Two things probably acted in the band's favour. Firstly, their beat take on harmony pop was incredibly middle of the road and subsequently enjoyed some airplay during the period. Besides that, reports from the frontline of the era would suggest they were also a versatile live act, as likely to please social and supper club audiences with music and comedy as they were Carnaby Street kids, and it's possible that Pye executives may have hoped that some of that crowd-pleasing ability would cross over into sales of physical product. This is a case of ""citation needed"" to the power of a hundred, obviously, but calculated guesswork is all we have in this peculiar case.","bearing the above in mind the career of dudleys the montanas also signed to pye along with everyones favourite muswell hill band is perplexing to any student of pop from they were allowed to release eight singles and also had this one reissued once in order to see if it had more",53,"luck","to","been","the","no","my","not","never","one","an","so",0.0200000000004366,FALSE

An average of 79.8% of email traffic in the three months to the end of September was junk. Of that, 14.8% originated in India, 10.6% came from Indonesia, and 9.7% from Brazil. Vijay Mukhi, an Internet security specialist in India‚Äôs financial capital, Mumbai, said spammers, forced to look for new bases after other countries cracked down on the practice, can act with impunity in India. ‚ÄòWe have an Information Technology Act that was introduced in 2000.

"10346","Tonight was the latest inspirational nudge. This started a few months ago when I had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the Bohus Stickning. Further stimulation from other knitters on Ravelry led me to read ""Poems of Color"" from cover to cover tonight. I'm already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors. I'm part Swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more I read about it. The fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt. I love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item. The patterns call for a 60/40 % Rambouillet & Angora blend. The idea of knitting an adult sweater on size 1,2, and 3 needles I think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesn't. I plan to knit a sample from the book Homespun Handknit called ""Northern Lights"". I will test the color choices that I plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater. I have some high grade ultra merino and Cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches. I feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters. It might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber I don't chose for the first. I begin to question, do I make the whole sweater blended wool/angora or just the colorwork? The fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft, should I make the body out of blended fiber too? I guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique. One downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater. Usually I'm a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but I already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true Bohus rather an inspired by Bohus Stickning. I don't plan on changing the color chart layout and I intend to keep the look so it will be easily recognizable as what inspired the design. For those of you who know the Bohus designs, imagine a ""Purple Shimmer"" or the ""Large Lace Collar"" in multiple hued mostly Purple, black and white tones over a white sweater body....","tonight was the latest inspirational nudge this started a few months ago when i had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the bohus stickning further stimulation from other knitters on ravelry led me to read poems of color from cover to cover tonight im already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one",64,"of","sure","the","it","me","up","you","them","your","his","their",0.0300000000006548,FALSE

The extent to which such charities or workshops exist or actually run in the increasingly over crowded prisons of today, I do not know. All I know is that I don't believe prison is the answer to today's ills. Brandishing everyone with the same brush is a crude form of self regulation for society. In the same way that one would not use a detention system in school time and again for every student if it wasn't working, surely society should look at the way it deals with apparent criminals. In light of what have been seen as very harsh recent punishments, I do have to question the motives behind them. Is it a sign of the stresses of today's society or of power crazed individuals? Are people trying to stamp their authority?
