It’s too much too fast and they get burned out, discouraged and finally quit. I think the same thought pattern could be applied to stopping smoking. It’s too daunting to go cold turkey. That’s extremely hard for most people but even the most cigarette addicted person could drop a cigarette or two from the norm each day. That’s progress and it’s to be celebrated. When that’s comfortable, they can drop another one or two a day. Slow and steady wins the race. Say they never, ever quit completely but they cut their cigarette intake by 75%.

"3989","Before looking into anything else, let us first give some background on Nietzsche’s personal experiences with the opposite sex. After his father died when he was only five, Nietzsche was left to be raised in a household solely occupied by women (his mother, his sister, and two maiden aunts). How much of an affect this had on developing the young man’s lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell, but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality. Throughout his life, Nietzsche had few companions (of either gender), and virtually no real romantic relationships (nothing that would qualify as reciprocal love, anyway). In his younger years, he would comment on his determination to remain a lifelong bachelor, because “on the whole, I hate the limitations and obligations of the whole civilized order of things so very much that it would be difficult to find a woman free-spirited enough to follow my lead.”[2] This remark is noteworthy for two reasons: first, his expectation that a woman (even a “free-spirited” one) is to follow his lead, indicates a base level of chauvinism in Nietzsche’s mentality towards women. And second, the philosopher seems to think his personal views are much too radical for any woman to either accept, or be capable of following. The letter also serves to illustrate the divergent tones the philosopher adopts, depending on who he is corresponding with at any given time. This is most evident from a later correspondence (this time with a woman), where Nietzsche uncharacteristically expresses a deep longing for a romantic partner:","before looking into anything else let us first give some background on nietzsche’s personal experiences with the opposite after his father died when he was only five nietzsche was left to be raised in a household solely occupied by women his mother his sister and two maiden aunts how much of an affect this had on developing the young man’s lifelong attitudes towards women is impossible to tell but it would be disingenuous to dismiss it as a triviality throughout his life nietzsche had few companions of either gender and virtually no real",94,"romantic","one","longer","matter","not","idea",0.00999999999839929,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No danger of him falling from a ladder again, and spending months in rehab (for a time he forgot his own name). No facing months of isolation because of cold temps and those same icy sidewalks. The facility organizes occasional trips for fishing and, at his request, to Dad's favorite casino, along with more sedate activities like bingo and tea time (I have seen my future and it includes jigsaw puzzles). In addition, it was easier for my siblings and I to visit and for Dad and Kay to ""host"" us without having to make special preparations.","last year on the first of june",8,"dad","the","my","this","course","his",0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"4684","Sarah’s death takes only two verse from Chapter 23; the remainder is dedicated to an unusually detailed accounting of a bargain and oral contract struck between Abraham and Ephron the Hittite. Getting back to our historical roots, this passage is a popular one for people trying to date the Torah, since it details a very specific sort of contract with some unusual-seeming invocations, but here again we end up struck by the staticity of Near East social customs, in that the various exhortations to “Hear me!” preceding an element of the contract are in fact standard parts of Mesopotamian oral-contract practice in several cultures spanning at least a millennium. If we ignore the peculiar verbiage, what we have is mostly a negotiation characterized by excessive politeness: buth the Hittites and Ephron himself are anxious to maintain good relations with Abraham, but the haggling is all upwards: despite Ephron’s offering of the cave as a gift, Abraham insists on paying for it. This might be indicative of a social custom (note: there have been, and still are, many cultures where it is polite to offer a desired item as a gift, and polite to refuse the gift; that might be what we’re seeing here), or a good-faith offer which Abraham refuses, presumably, because of his fierce independence (which we saw previously in 15:23, where Abraham didn’t want to enrich himself from the spoils of war). Incidentally, this little exchange means, historically and in modernity, Jews have asserted their right to ownership of the cave of Machpelah in Hebron on rather different grounds than that to the rest of Israel: it’s theirs because they bought it. Since it’s also a Muslim holy site, this is, unsurprisingly, a hotly debated contention.","sarah’s death takes only two verse from chapter the remainder is dedicated to an unusually detailed accounting of a bargain and contract struck between abraham and ephron the hittite getting back to our historical roots this passage is a popular one for people trying to date the torah since it details a very specific sort of contract with some unusualseeming invocations but here again we end up struck by the staticity of near east social customs in that the various exhortations to “hear me” preceding an element of the contract are in fact standard parts of mesopotamian contract practice in several cultures spanning at least a millennium if we ignore the peculiar verbiage what we have is mostly a negotiation characterized by excessive politeness buth the hittites and ephron himself are anxious to maintain good relations with abraham but the haggling is all upwards despite ephron’s offering of the",150,"cave","the","my","this","course","his",0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So PTSD, or any major stress factor, may make a naturally aggressive person more susceptible to lashing out in anger than a less aggressive person.

Her days as one of freak-folk’s most playful flower children are behind her, though her predilection for melodic concision and arms-length thematic disclosure remains almost confrontationally intact.

"5107","I’ve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that, ethically, it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn’t stereotyping people or attack them for their sexual beliefs, comedic intentions aside. Instead, tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that I, along with the rest of the public, should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized. Why had I been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes—or even just assumptions—go as if it was nothing? As if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world, and that I wasn’t giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time I stayed silent? The basic answer is that I had seen the exploitation of gender and sex be treated as nothing so many times before, both in my real life, and, arguably more importantly for improv comedy, in television comedies. I think it’s very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm. Television, which is such a staple in most American homes, works like that. It’s not real life, and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there. Famously, this works on a number of different levels. Subconsciously, one might think of the first televised presidential debate in 1960 in which Kennedy beat out Nixon, as I had been taught in school, because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television. More consciously, and timely, consider the SNL Sarah Palin sketches? How many times was Sarah asked if she could see Russia from her house in her real political campaigns because of a fictitious depiction of herself. With so many people watching and talking about it, it became main stream.","i’ve always been interested in moral issues and it seemed to me that ethically it was backward to be surprised by someone who doesn’t stereotyping people or attack them for their beliefs comedic intentions aside instead tolerance and acceptance should be such commonplace ideas that i along with the rest of the public should be intent on causing a fuss until we see them become normalized why had i been so okay with holding my tongue and letting so many jokes—or even just assumptions—go as if it was nothing as if they had no real effect on the way that power functions in the world and that i wasn’t giving in and letting go some of my personal power every time i stayed silent the basic answer is that i had seen the exploitation of gender and be treated as nothing so many times before both in my real life and arguably more importantly for improv comedy in television comedies i think it’s very easy for life to imitate art when art becomes so popular and pervasive that it stops being considered an interpretation or a commentary and becomes instead the norm television which is such a staple in most american homes works like that it’s not real life and yet people are willing to make real life opinions and decisions based on what they see and hear there famously this works on a number of different levels subconsciously one might think of the first televised presidential debate in in which kennedy beat out nixon as i had been taught in school because he was more handsome and appealing when seen on television more consciously and timely",278,"consider","the","then","it","that","we",0.0299999999988358,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In its simplest form, it merely consists of wearing clothes that are much too tight. Jackets no longer button, trousers creak anxiously as the owner sits down: these are worn by the small fry, by the clerks, petty officials, grocers, concièrges and mechanics who are making enough money to eat as they never ate before, but not enough to buy new clothes. They are to be found smiling over the menu in those comfortable homey little bistros in the centre of Paris, where the price of dishes is not marked and where the best dishes are not even written down. After them, are the people who could buy themselves a dozen new suits if they chose but, feeling that life is uncertain and the future shrouded in darkness, prefer to put their money into things that will not only last but, at a pinch, can be negotiated: gems flash from their fingers and neckties, their ladies are loaded with diamonds in such profusion they can hardly set one foot before the other.

The furious activity of the daytime scenes, from the gathering of the wounded and the grisly operations, to the disposal of the corpses, is juxtaposed against relatively still evening scenes, preventing the mind from going numb from a surfeit of horror. The story of a nurse satisfying the sexual needs of amputees — with its extreme violence and lack of a comforting historical distance — was decidedly unlikely to appeal to audiences accustomed to the comparatively genteel films of Ozu and Imamura or the reassuringly familiar works of Kurosawa. Grim, horrifying, at times unrelentingly violent, Masumura’s Red Angel is also filled with some of the most agonizingly tender moments to be seen in any film.","one of the exciting aspects of the film not remarked by other critics is the outstanding construction and excellently judged pacing which keeps the story moving briskly along",29,"the","in","from","forward","away","sidewalk",0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It was my first day at Catawba and I was in the bookstore with my parents. Our orientation hadn't started yet so we were killing time walking around campus. I was excited, but nervous, and I think some of that nervousness is what made me react the way I did. I saw Anna in the bookstore. She smiled at me, and said hi...and I didn't respond! I have no idea why. I am not the kind of person who would just ignore a random stranger like that. But for some reason, I looked at her, and decided that she was a snob. When my orientation class began later that day, I walked into the room and realized that the ""snob"" I had seen in the bookstore was in my class! Our orientation classes were small. I think mine had 12 people in it, so what were the odds of the snobby girl from the bookstore being in the same class as me. Later that day, after our parents had left, and we were left alone to mingle with our new friends, Anna and I started talking. I realized in an instant that my initial assessment of her was 100% wrong. She was clearly one of the sweetest girls I had ever met. We became instant friends. For years after that moment, we would joke about the bookstore incident. It turns out that when she saw me in orientation she thought ""Oh great, the snobby girl who ignored me in the bookstore is in my class."" So at random moments throughout the next 12 years she would say to me ""I can't believe you thought I was a snob!"" or I would say ""I can't believe I ever thought that you were snobby"" and we'd have a good laugh about it!","anna was one of the first people that i met at catawba we used to joke around about how we met because i actually met her before i really met her it was my first day at catawba and i was in the bookstore with my parents our orientation",50,"hadnt","own","lives","first","little","family",0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Like the 90 degree heat and the rainy weather we've had lately. Which means that the wood is pretty much at it's largest right now.

That means that as the deck ages, the wood will actually dry out and shrink, causing the what began as 1/8"" gap to become even bigger.

Some singers can slur their words to great effect, helping them to create a certain type of character. That was Askew’s strategy before, and I enjoyed the results. But now she is singing her words clearly, possibly so that they can be made out above the band, and this frees her.

Told from Oskar’s perspective, the novel is densely narrated and punctuated by typographic experiments that reflect the young boy’s quest to ‘solve’ the final puzzle left behind by his father, who had died in the World Trade Center attacks. Unsurprisingly, Stephen Daldry’s film version (adapted for the screen by Eric Roth) suffers precisely because cinema – especially mainstream, commercial cinema – simply does not lend itself to those kinds of highly internalised narratives. As a novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close draws its impact from this internalisation, delving deep into Oskar’s world and taking the reader along for the ride. And although the book wasn’t immune from similar criticisms, attempts to translate this world onto the screen saw Daldry’s film shouted down (in the UK at least) as ‘annoying’, ‘irritating’ and ‘cloying’.","in contrast to reza’s multitude of shifting perspectives jonathan safran foer’s novel extremely loud incredibly close offered an intriguing firstperson selfportrait of precocious youngster named oskar schell contrasting personal and public loss in the aftermath of told from oskar’s perspective the novel is densely narrated and punctuated by typographic experiments that reflect the young boy’s quest to ‘solve’ the final puzzle left behind by his father who had died in the world trade center attacks unsurprisingly stephen daldry’s film version adapted for the screen by eric roth suffers precisely because cinema – especially mainstream commercial cinema –",98,"simply","this","scene",NA,NA,NA,0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The state began sending referrals to other foster care agencies. The Catholic charities challenged the state in court and lost at both the circuit and appellate levels. They ultimately had to drop the case due to a lack of funds to appeal it further up the chain.

In 1953 Dale Moody wrote an article titled “The Translation of John 3:16 in the Revised Standard Version,” which is often cited by others. At the end of this article he declares that 1 Clement 15:2 (“there is a bird which is called the Phoenix …”) “shows clearly that the above conclusions on monogenes are correct,” because “the Phoenix was neither born nor begotten, but it could be monogenes, the only one of its kind!” Apparently Moody never looked at the passage to which he refers, which explicitly describes how a succession of solitary Phoenixes are begotten and born, by some autogenic process. The passage even decribes how the Phoenix disposes of the bones of its parent. It is “one of its kind” only in the sense that there is just one living at any one time. As we noted above, Clement’s whole interest in this mythological bird lies in its death and rebirth.","passing on from longenecker to others who have argued similarly we find the same low quality of scholarship in which the arguments depend entirely upon a few dubious examples in combination with wordstudy fallacies in dale moody wrote an article titled “the translation of john in the revised standard version” which is often cited by others at the end of this article he declares that clement “there is a bird which is called the phoenix ” “shows clearly that the above conclusions on monogenes are correct” because “the phoenix was neither born nor begotten but it could be monogenes the only one of its kind” apparently moody never looked at the passage to which he refers which explicitly describes how a succession of solitary phoenixes are begotten and born by some autogenic process the passage even decribes how the phoenix disposes of the bones of its parent it is “one of its kind” only in the sense that there is just one living at any one time as we noted above",172,"clement’s","that","the","many","for","here",0.0299999999988358,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, in serious cases such as murder, there might be a variety of charges accompanying the main charge, and these are left in the indictment to allow evidence to be led about them, but often, just before the case goes to the jury, the prosecutor will drop all but the murder charge, so as to “simplify” matters for the jury. After all, if the accused is convicted of murder any additional conviction for breach of the peace will make no difference to their sentence.","dealing with the specifics you mention some of the matters",11,"you","same","first","most","world","time",0.0400000000008731,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One section of the museum is dedicated to housing the varied treasures of the boy king Tutankhamun aka king Tut. King Tut’s artifacts came from his tomb and included over 3500 treasures and affluent items that he supposedly used throughout his life. These artifacts ranged in items made of gold, silver, precious gems, calcite, alabaster, etc., such as golden perfume bottles and amulets, the Wadjet or eye of Horus, canonic chests and shrine, statue of an one horned Oryx, golden scarab necklace, golden buckle depicting a chariot drawn by horses, the gilded throne and statutes, including life-size statues (1 meter 73 cm) of King Tut. Additionally, two of the three sarcophagi in which king Tut was laid to rest as a mummy are on display, with the third outermost (not on display), made of complete gold and weighing 450 kilograms (over 990 pounds), resting today in the Valley of the Kings housing his mummy still. But the highlight of the museum (a must see to all who visit) is king Tut’s funerary mask, which was found placed over the mummified head of the king. It is made of gold and inlaid with precious stones (lapis lazuli, turquoise, and carnelian), weighing 11 kilograms (nearly 25 pounds) and is believed to represent what the king really look like. Suffice it to say, that the king certainly lived an extremely affluent life and an inscription on his tomb door declares the king had “spent his life in fashioning the images of the gods”.","during our visit to the egyptian museum in cairo egypt we spent hours looking at the ancient pharonic antiquities and artifacts on display one section of the museum is dedicated to housing the varied treasures of the boy king tutankhamun aka king tut king tut’s artifacts came from his tomb and included over treasures and affluent items that he supposedly used throughout his life these artifacts ranged in items made of gold silver precious gems calcite alabaster etc such as golden perfume bottles and amulets the wadjet or eye of horus canonic chests and shrine statue of an one horned oryx golden scarab necklace golden buckle depicting a chariot drawn by horses the gilded throne and statutes including lifesize statues meter cm of king tut additionally two of the three sarcophagi in which king tut was laid to rest as a mummy are on display with the third",149,"outermost","same","first","most","world","time",0.0200000000004366,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I loved this: lots of fresh and juicy red berry flavours on a light and quite dry base. The near-6% ABV is well hidden. The missus opted for Camden Ink, a keg stout though one mercifully served without nitro. It's an intensely heavy beer with lots of gorgeous roast grain on the nose. Tasting starts with a gentle caress of chocolate followed by a major jolt of espresso.

They released their debut album, “The Secret Life Of The Veronicas” in 2005 and found great success in their homeland of Australia, as well as throughout parts of Europe, but did not fare quite as well throughout much of Europe or here in the United States. While they certainly found a niche here in the States between their debut and their sophomore record, “Hook Me Up,” they have always remained just shy of any major mainstream success here, which is a shame because their music is absolutely brilliant! They are one of my absolute favorite bands and both of their albums are among my top 10 favorite albums of all-time, “The Secret Life…” being my second favorite of all-time, (second only to the self-titled debut album from Scissor Sisters.) I am definitely biased in my opinion of the Veronicas. I have seen them in concert 5 times and actually met them 4 of those times. In fact, below you can see pics of me with them, (at a very different, very bearded period in my life,) as well as a little collection of autographed memorabilia I have framed on my bedroom wall from my various run-ins with them.

"6612","The confusion over treaty rights and special privileges is similar to how most Americans view reservations in general. The idea that reservations or fishing and hunting rights are something the Americans “gave” to the Indians after defeating them in war is absolutely ridiculous. Reservations are instead usually the one thing the Americans didn’t take after forcing Indians to compromise over endless war or peace.

"6776","The character of Erlendur is a study in grief. Searching (for the lost loved-one) is a common feature of bereavement and Erlendur’s life as a policeman is an extension of his futile search for his lost brother. It is a recurring aspect of the Reykjavik Crime Mysteries that the crime under investigation is often an old one in which the identity of the victim becomes as important to uncover as the murderer. And so the constant theme of these books is the solution of crime through the excavation of the past (in Silence of the Grave, Erlendur literally calls in archaeologists to help). Compared with many other crime novels, the outcome of Erlendur’s investigations is often unconventional in that the plot is not resolved by the arrest of the murderer. The reason for this is that the stories mainly consist of a search for a missing person; sometimes this is a search for the murderer, but just as often it is a search for the identity of the victim, or, if the victim is known, a search for some truth about their life that will reveal their real identity. Not all of these missing persons are successfully found.","the character of erlendur is a study in grief searching for the lost lovedone is a common feature of bereavement and erlendur’s life as a policeman is an extension of his futile search for his lost brother it is",40,"a","was","is","and","would","to",0.0300000000006548,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Then, when HarperCollins asked me for a sequel – and a third after that – I discovered myself writing a trilogy after all. And the books got darker and stronger as I went along. There were threads running through all three – the same characters, obviously, though I added new ones in each book as Peer and Hilde grew older and had more adventures – but also threads of self-discovery, and the longing to travel far away to distant lands. And – of course – romance. It was clear to me even in the first book that Peer was going to fall in love with Hilde. It was a lot less clear that she would feel the same way about him. Indeed, even in Book 1, there’s a handsome fisherman, Arne, who is an obvious rival for Hilde’s affections. The path of true love never did run smooth, and Peer and Hilde have an awful lot to face, and to discover about themselves and others, before they really come to know their own hearts.

"6804","Also around this time Bo Coach bid farewell to Mr Korg and brought in Casio RX-1 as well as Denise Y whom handled Casio RX-1 in shows as well as providing vocals and sound effects. Right around this time the band started to put together The Mustard Tape. In true lo fi indie rock fashion, over the span of several weekends, and various basements the songs that made up The Mustard Tape were recorded. In fact most songs on this release were recorded in a different room and on a different date. Originally the core of what was to make up The Mustard Tape were recorded by myself and the band on my old Fostex 4 track at Chris Grant's old house one drunken weekend while his parent's were out of town. Originally recorded that night were ""Mannequin"", ""Welcome Citizens"", ""Fast One"", and ""Head On"""" as well as a cover of The Velvet Underound's ""Heroin"" which was recored well past the inebriated state. Of those songs the only recordings that were kept for release on The Mustard Tape were ""Fast One"" and ""Head On"" as well as all of the out takes that feature Ed playing a guitar nowhere near in tune and somehow playing the melody backwards. Still to this day I can't for the life of me fathom what was wrong with the recordings of ""Mannequin"" and ""Welcome Citizens"" that we did that night. Honestly, they sounded beautiful. Especially ""Mannequin"" the way the violin melody and Conover's vocals so wondrously meshed together. If I recall correctly Noah quipped that they ""sounded too pretty, not dirty enough"" or something to that effect. And hence that is why the version of ""Mannequin"" that does appear on The Mustard Tape is as lo fi as possible. ""Welcome Citizens"" was re- worked when the band combined it with the Half Japanese-esque rambling oddity of""Uncle Roy"" and performed (and subsequently recorded) it as ""Uncle Roy/Welcome Citizens"" at Coffee House which was like a talent show held at Shoreham Wading River High School. You were only supposed to play one song so the figured ""heck with that let's make two songs one"".

This was a perplexing amount of faith to show a band which, from its beat beginnings right to its sunshine pop end, never really showed much sales potential. Two things probably acted in the band's favour. Firstly, their beat take on harmony pop was incredibly middle of the road and subsequently enjoyed some airplay during the period. Besides that, reports from the frontline of the era would suggest they were also a versatile live act, as likely to please social and supper club audiences with music and comedy as they were Carnaby Street kids, and it's possible that Pye executives may have hoped that some of that crowd-pleasing ability would cross over into sales of physical product.

"7052","11 Khaleej Times on India being a junk-mail country. India has emerged as the world’s top source of junk mail as spammers make use of lax laws and absent enforcement to turn the country into a centre of unsolicited email. A recent report by Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based global Internet security firm, says more spam was sent from the south Asian giant than anywhere else in the world in the third quarter of the year. An average of 79.8% of email traffic in the three months to the end of September was junk. Of that, 14.8% originated in India, 10.6% came from Indonesia, and 9.7% from Brazil. Vijay Mukhi, an Internet security specialist in India’s financial capital, Mumbai, said spammers, forced to look for new bases after other countries cracked down on the practice, can act with impunity in India. ‘We have an Information Technology Act that was introduced in 2000. But we don’t have any convictions under it and it’s silent on spam,’ he told AFP. ‘If I’m a spammer, I would rather spam from India to India and the rest of world because nothing will happen to me.’ India’s booming mobile phone sector, which has recently seen the introduction of third-generation smart phones, also provides a potential open door for spam and malware (malicious software), industry figures say.","khaleej times on india being a junkmail country india has emerged as the world’s top source of junk mail as spammers make use of lax laws and absent enforcement to turn the country into a centre of unsolicited email a recent report by kaspersky lab a moscowbased global internet security firm says more spam was sent from the south asian giant than anywhere else in the world in the third quarter of the year an average of of email traffic in the three months to the end of september was junk of that originated in india came from indonesia and from brazil vijay mukhi an internet security specialist in india’s financial capital mumbai said spammers forced to look for new bases after other countries cracked down on the practice can act with impunity in india ‘we have an information technology act that was introduced in but we don’t have any convictions under it and it’s silent on spam’ he told afp ‘if i’m a spammer i would rather spam from india to india and the rest of world because nothing will happen to me’ india’s booming mobile phone sector which has recently seen the introduction of thirdgeneration smart phones also",201,"provides","and","have","is","then",NA,0.0200000000004366,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"7108","Tonight was the latest inspirational nudge. This started a few months ago when I had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the Bohus Stickning. Further stimulation from other knitters on Ravelry led me to read ""Poems of Color"" from cover to cover tonight. I'm already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors. I'm part Swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more I read about it. The fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt. I love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item. The patterns call for a 60/40 % Rambouillet & Angora blend. The idea of knitting an adult sweater on size 1,2, and 3 needles I think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesn't. I plan to knit a sample from the book Homespun Handknit called ""Northern Lights"". I will test the color choices that I plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater. I have some high grade ultra merino and Cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches. I feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters. It might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber I don't chose for the first. I begin to question, do I make the whole sweater blended wool/angora or just the colorwork? The fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft, should I make the body out of blended fiber too? I guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique. One downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater. Usually I'm a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but I already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true Bohus rather an inspired by Bohus Stickning. I don't plan on changing the color chart layout and I intend to keep the look so it will be easily recognizable as what inspired the design. For those of you who know the Bohus designs, imagine a ""Purple Shimmer"" or the ""Large Lace Collar"" in multiple hued mostly Purple, black and white tones over a white sweater body....","tonight was the latest inspirational nudge this started a few months ago when i had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the bohus stickning further stimulation from other knitters on ravelry led me to read poems of color from cover to cover tonight im already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors im part swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more i read about it the fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt i love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item the patterns call for a rambouillet angora blend the idea of knitting an adult sweater on size and needles i think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesnt i plan to knit a sample from the book homespun handknit called northern lights i will test the color choices that i plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater i have some high grade ultra merino and cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches i feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters it might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber i dont chose for the first i begin to question do i make the whole sweater blended woolangora or just the colorwork the fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft should i make the body out of blended fiber too i guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique one downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater usually im a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but i already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true bohus rather an inspired by bohus stickning i dont plan on changing the color chart layout and i intend to keep the look",403,"so","same","first","most","world","time",0.0299999999988358,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
