In a number of places the Rwandan canons clearly are repudiation of the Thirty-Nine Articles and of authentic historic Anglicanism, and embrace in their place the dogmas of the Council of Trent. The provisions governing the relationship of the Rwandan Primate with Anglican Primatial Vicar Chuck Murphy are based upon the provisions of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law governing the relationship of the Pope to lesser bishops of the Roman Catholic Church.

"747","After the deposition of Mubarak, foreign aid, which the country greatly relied upon, was suspended in Egypt. Now, many countries are focusing on reestablishing foreign assistance in the hopes of being able to play a part in Egypt‚Äôs new political state and influence future developments in the country (Ruivaran). The United States has heavily financed Egypt‚Äôs government, including Mubarak‚Äôs oppressive regime, of which the United States overlooked the abuse of human rights. This financial aid to Egypt holds some roots in the 1950s, when many Western European countries and the United States were looking to support those ‚Äúautocratic local leaders who would keep order and were most sympathetic to their Cold War policies ‚Äì a opposed to those of the Soviet Union ‚Äì and were most likely to maintain a friendly attitude toward U.S. and European business interests‚Äù (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 265). The new government and its new policies will complicate the U.S. involvement and interests in the region. In the future, the U.S. will have to take into account their previous act of turning a blind eye to the misrepresentation of human rights and promote a full democratic government in the country. The Muslim Brotherhood, currently in control of much of the government, is traditionally an anti-Israeli group, which brings the possibility of tensions between Israel, a U.S. ally, and Egypt, two countries which currently share a Peace Treaty since 1979. A new government led by the Brotherhood could overturn this treaty and ‚Äúindefinitely affect U.S. military, trade, and diplomatic policies‚Äù (Travers). Egypt also happens to have a geographically important location in regards to the Suez Canal ‚Äúwhich allows transport of over 2 million barrels of oil per day out of the Persian Gulf‚Äù (Travers) and therefore gives Egypt some control over oil prices and the cost of international shipping. The region itself is known for its oil exports, prices of which are mostly controlled by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which also include countries in Latin America and the Far East (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 278). However, in the event that transportation costs for shipping oil rise, the cost of oil will also increase, impacting consumers all over the globe, especially Americans who, as a nation, consumer more oil than any other country worldwide. Though Egypt is not a major producer of oil, the country‚Äôs control of the waterway gives it the power of affecting the global economy through oil prices.","after the deposition of mubarak foreign aid which the country greatly relied upon was suspended in egypt now many countries are",22,"focusing","are","31B","countries","32C","the","31A","made","31A",0.540000000000873,FALSE

First, Warner points to and Halperin fleshes out how the insistence on ‚ÄúGay Pride‚Äù can actually serve to deepen the shame gay men feel about their desires and practices, by re-relegating them to the closet in contra-distinction to an out-and-proud gay-maleness. Second, Halperin turns to a right-wing French writer, Marcel Jouhandeau, who extolled the virtues of social abjection and, in particular, humiliation at being different: Jouhandeau (and later, Genet) turn abjection on its head, into a kind of sacrilization of abjection. To tease this out, thirdly, Halperin explicates two scenes from Jean Genet‚Äôs opus, in which Genet depicts social abjection, humiliation, as a process and where the abjected, humiliated subject responds by resignifying the abjection as either a source of pleasure or as the signifying source of his difference. In Halperin‚Äôs interpretation, Genet‚Äôs narrators find freedom precisely by identifying with their abjection and embracing it, refusing its deleterious effects and instead creating for themselves a re-signifying and life-affirming defiance. The more they are humiliated, the more defiant and ecstatic the narrators become. Genet‚Äôs narrative insists that loving someone who is humiliated (socially abject) requires the loving of their abjection itself.","halperin‚Äôs insights are manifold in this rich section of the book here i list those that were most salient to me as i read first warner points to and halperin fleshes out how the insistence on ‚Äúgay pride‚Äù can actually serve to deepen the shame gay men feel about their desires and practices by rerelegating them to the closet in contradistinction to an outandproud gaymaleness second halperin turns to a rightwing french writer marcel jouhandeau who extolled the virtues of social abjection and in particular humiliation at being different jouhandeau and later genet turn abjection on its head into a kind of sacrilization of abjection to tease this out thirdly halperin explicates two scenes from jean genet‚Äôs opus in which genet depicts social abjection humiliation as a process and where the abjected humiliated subject responds by resignifying the abjection as either a source of pleasure or as the signifying source of his difference in halperin‚Äôs interpretation genet‚Äôs narrators find freedom precisely by identifying with their abjection and embracing it refusing its deleterious effects and instead creating for themselves a resignifying and lifeaffirming defiance the more they are",188,"humiliated","are","41C","a","31A","are","31B","are","32B",0.559999999997672,FALSE
